Citizens are free to install lift kits and after-market wheels, as well as grill guards, performance shocks, and after-market bumpers. The Industrial Truck Association (ITA, ) has defined seven classes of lift trucks, or forklifts, which are defined by the type of engine, work environment, operator position and equipment characteristics.

<h2>Forklift Sales & Service In Lockport </h2>
<p>A forklift is a type of material handling lift that has two prongs attached to the front of it. These prongs look like a tuning fork and assist in the lifting of objects. The forklift's center of gravity moves when you accelerate, brake, or turn. With a capacity to pack them one on top of each other, our range of material handling equipment reduces the transporting time by half.</p>
<p>All types of dockboards should be designed and maintained so the end edges will have a substantial contact with the dock (or loading platform) and the carrier to prevent the dockboard from rocking of sliding. The increased tire size and ground clearance makes off-roading increasingly possible by limiting the potential damage of debris, as well as providing an overall smoother ride across the rough ground.</p>
