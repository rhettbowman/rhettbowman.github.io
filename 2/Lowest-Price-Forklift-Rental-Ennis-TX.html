When it comes to forklift sales, it's important to find a reliable dealer who you can trust to provide a value-for-money solution. Manual pallet jacks have a capacity of about 5500 lbs. The scale of materials transported and lifts used varies greatly depending on the type of industry in question.</p>

Many people choose to hire their forklifts, but there are a multitude of benefits associated with buying forklifts outright.</p>

Different forklifts are made for different loading capacity and height of pallet racks.

Standard 2-ton counterbalance forklifts can cost over $20,000 in good condition, and many cost much more when brought brand new.
