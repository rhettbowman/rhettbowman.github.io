<p>You can already see that lifted trucks have some real advantages when it comes to going off-road, thanks to the greater clearance they enjoy. Operators should be trained to operate the type of trucks they work on. They should also know the potential risks for each model.

In this guide, we'll show you how to choose the correct shocks for a truck equipped with a lift kit.</p>
