<p>Application Hydraulic hand pallet truck is widely used in various industries to lift loads. Altorfer Lift Truck is proud to be a member of the Material Handling Equipment Distributors Association (MHEDA).

Some forklifts use a single hydraulic cylinder to elevate the boom, while others use two cylinders. While moving palletized loads is fastest and easiest, these machines can load and unload a variety of objects.</p>
<p>The majority of fatalities stem from forklift turnovers, so an obvious advantage of pushing a cart as opposed to sitting in a vehicle is not going down with the ship, so to speak, if it slips off a loading dock or tips due to an unbalanced load. A wide variety of industrial reach trucks options are available to you, such as new.

Our Rough Terrain Forklift Train the Trainer Course, as well as our other Train the Trainer courses, are a great option for organizations looking to have one or more employees that can teach and certify various safety topics relevant to your business.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you're towing a heavy load, a lifted suspension provides the benefit of having more room to settle before the weight of the load bottoms out. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test # OP1 or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable. The new Toyota high capacity reach forklifts are developed for intensive stacking applications focusing on productivity, reliability, ergonomics (controls, steering and seat adapted to the driver's needs) and most importantly safety.</p>
