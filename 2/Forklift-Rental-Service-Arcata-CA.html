If you have previously owned a forklift, determine what aspects you liked and didn't like about the lift.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are order picker trucks that have forks that are fixed in front of the platform and thus cannot be moved. As a result, drivers will feel sleek and cool behind the wheel of some cheap used lifted trucks for sale. The SP Series 4-wheel platform stock picker is a heavy-duty stand-up lift truck used in areas where loads are bulky or extra long, such as furniture or department store warehouses.</p>
<p>Other narrow aisle trucks include stand up straddles, swing masts, side loaders, and turret trucks.
