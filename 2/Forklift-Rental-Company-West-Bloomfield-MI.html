Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load. There are some specialty trucks that are used in specific industries or in certain settings, such as a sideloader that picks up and carries pallets to the side of the vehicle instead of in the front.</p>
