<h2>New & Used Forklifts, Forklift Service, Parts, Rentals & Training Choctaw </h2>
<p>Perhaps the inventory that needs to be moved will pay for the rentals, or money is just tight right now. Save time and money with the compact and manoeuvrable 25 industrial forklift. Observe forklift operators in their daily work and take prompt corrective action to correct careless or unsafe operations. In our inventory you can explore a variety of new and used electric, internal combustion, and rough terrain forklifts, as well as a number of boom lifts and floor cleaners.</p>
<p>In trucks where the operator stands, a vertical clearance of at least 74 inches should be maintained from the platform where he stands to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation. Although lifted trucks can make hitting the trail a lot easier, they do have some drawbacks that you want to keep in mind before committing to one.</p>
<p>With a body lift, clearances are increased for larger tires without the changes to suspension height or alignment angles. You'll also read about the most popular kinds of forklifts, helping you select the right rental for your needs. Choosing the right tires will impact on your forklift's handling and safety.
