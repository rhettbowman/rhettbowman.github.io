This perk makes rough terrain forklifts ideal for busy construction sites with limited space. With FLC's counterbalance forklift certification, you're covered in case of an accident. You can choose between a body lift kit, a suspension lift kit, and leveling lift kits. This is a testament to the impact that lift truck manufacturers and dealers have on the U.S. economy, says Johnson, and also the critical nature of operator training and safety in the context of the workplace.</p>

<p>These sorts of lifted trucks drive differently than stock models, due to the change of suspension and higher center of gravity, but can utilize mush larger tires than a factory model. Advances in machinery made life easier for warehouse personnel; one of these important innovations was the pallet jack, which is basically a type of forklift. Many of the most serious forklift accidents happen when a driver drops a payload.</p>

<p>Well, one of the simplest ways to make a truck stand out is integrating a body lift kit or suspension lift kit. You can rent top-quality and expertly-maintained equipment at United Rentals. These are classifications of six commonly-used types of forklifts, as recognized by OSHA, along with different types of trucks unique to each class.

<p>On the other hand, it's a more expensive method, while a body lift is a cheaper way to get a little more ride height and still improve your truck's off-roading abilities. You typically gain 1-3 inches of ground clearance with a suspension lift kit. Also referred to as a "warehouse forklift," this truck is designed to work indoors on flat ground. Due to the presence of the boom lift, this machine is considered a partially loaded truck even without a load on the attachment.</p>
<p>A lifted truck also has a higher resale value because of how valuable these trucks are. We have used lifted trucks in stock from time-to-time, but we cannot guarantee availability on pre-owned models due to frequent changes in our inventory. As a result, customers should contact our team with questions about these suspension lift kits. The taller tires get the differential higher off the ground, reducing the risk of damage from obstacles, and all four wheels gain maximum traction due to the lifted suspension.</p>
