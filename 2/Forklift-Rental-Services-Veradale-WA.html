Berry Material Handling carries new Load Lifter rough terrain forklift models for a variety of applications. 7 Each unit is started and run through a series of functional tests with actual loads for up to 1.5 hours. The same is applicable for forklift trucks too. In the past decade, the number of reach trucks with mast heights over eight meters has increased considerably and even heights of 13 meters are no longer a rarity.</p>

<p>In addition, one should always check the capacity plate as it gives important information for how heavy a load the forklift can handle, as well as information about the tires, tilt degrees and other knowledge necessary to safe operating. A loading plate for loading reference is usually located on the forklift. The type of load also matters as there are specific forklift attachments that can enhance a standard forklift and help you move the load more efficiently.</p>
<p>Be sure the load is centered and the forks are completely under the load before lifting. Use these machines to tackle residential or commercial landscaping jobs. 2. Three-Wheel Counterbalance - These forklifts feature three wheels as opposed to four in their counterbalance forerunners.

Once you've found the right type of rough terrain forklift for your job site, the biggest decision you'll have to make is between renting and buying.</p>
<p>That's why it's so important for operators to complete FLT counterbalance license training and receive their forklift operator certification.
