The industrial forklift —also called a large capacity forklift—combines the functionalities of a warehouse forklift with that of a telehandler.</p>
<p>Second, you need to make sure you request a rental unit which has the specifications best suited to the loads you are trying to move. If you're searching for forklift companies in Victoria and Melbourne that offer exceptional quality customer service as well as unparalleled machinery, Damoli is for you.
