You can install both a suspension lift and a body lift. Raymond stand up lift trucks are multipurpose vehicles designed to work alone or with other systems as part of a total material handling solution.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>Go look on the trails that I drive and you won't see any of the radically lifted trucks at all. Raymond sit down lift trucks are intelligently engineered and designed to work as stand-alone products or as part of an integrated material handling solution, helping operators move products throughout any warehouse. Can be used indoors and outdoors for loads 2,000lbs+.</p>

<p>Depending on your needs, you may find that a pallet jack is the best fit for your warehouse or product. These trucks like most of our products come up with the option of customization. Wrap orders before loading on trucks. In North America, reach trucks are typically stand up trucks. If the operator is riding in the order picking truck, they wear a specially designed safety harness to prevent falls.</p>
