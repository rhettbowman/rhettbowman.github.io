<p>Considerations include forklift type, capacity, carriage type, and number of hydraulic functions (that power the attachment features). In the past most order picking jobs were carried out on ground level to increase the productivity, while stock was replenished to the bottom layer with reach & fork trucks. A typical lift truck uses two power-operated horizontal prongs (forks) that can be raised and lowered for loading, transporting, and unloading goods, particularly goods stacked on wooden pallets.</p>
<p>Powerhouses like the Ford F-150 already command the road, but lifted trucks provide that extra level of customization that demand attention. Order picker trucks are another type of Class II electric motor narrow aisle truck. Rough terrain forklifts come in 2WD and 4WD variants; however, 4WD variant is the all-rounder that can accomplish all kinds of difficult tasks on rough terrain.</p>
