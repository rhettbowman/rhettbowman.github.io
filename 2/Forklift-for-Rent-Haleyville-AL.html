Well, you're going to have to work a little bit harder than a 6” suspension lift to pimp your truck out, but it's still doable. Theoretically this is to increase off-road performance, although the higher center of gravity would likely make them more likely to roll over on rough terrain.</p>

Wrap orders before loading on trucks. In North America, reach trucks are typically stand up trucks. If the operator is riding in the order picking truck, they wear a specially designed safety harness to prevent falls.</p>
<p>When it is necessary to omit the overhead guard, special attention should be given by the user and operator to conditions such as height and stability of loads and stacks, weight of individual units, and operating space including overhead obstructions. Whether you use rough terrain forklifts every day or once in awhile, these machines can handle major wear and tear.</p>
