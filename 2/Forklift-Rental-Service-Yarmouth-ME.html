<p>Studies have shown that there are roughly 900,000 Rough Terrain Forklifts used every day in U.S. businesses. Citizens are free to install lift kits and after-market wheels, as well as grill guards, performance shocks, and after-market bumpers. The Industrial Truck Association (ITA, ) has defined seven classes of lift trucks, or forklifts, which are defined by the type of engine, work environment, operator position and equipment characteristics. In some cases, you may be looking to expand your business or take on work that requires equipment you don't have, like a forklift.</p>
<p>Adding a Pro Comp lift kit to your vehicle will help to maintain vehicle ride height, reduce the effect of shock forces, maintain wheel alignment, support loaded weight, and control the direction of travel for your truck or SUV. Often called a tugger,” these versatile machines are most commonly used for pulling loads from Point A to Point B rather than lifting.</p>

If you lift a load too high, you can cause the forklift to tip over. As time has passed, forklifts have tended to specialization.</p>
<p>Our range of Super Short Hand Pallet Truck is scientifically designed to achieve maximum production capacity with minimum human efforts. These types of forklifts are faster and much more powerful than electric forklifts, but are also much louder. Agria forklifts are fitted with industry leading Deutz or Perkins diesel engines to provide the extra power necessary to operate over rough terrain whilst carrying heavy loads.</p>
