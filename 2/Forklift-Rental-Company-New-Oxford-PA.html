Our industrial reach forklift truck training course will provide learners with the basic knowledge and practical skills involved in safely operating an industrial reach forklift truck.</p>
<p>Powered industrial trucks can either be ridden by the operator or controlled by a walking operator. Generally, the smallest capacity cushion available, the 3,000 lb. is a light-duty truck ideal for warehouses and production lines. A lifted truck has its suspension raised and may have its engine modified to be louder, creating a true white trash experience. Constructed with either internal combustion engines or electric motors, reach trucks come in three main types: straddle reach trucks, standup reach trucks or double deep reach trucks.</p>
<p>Welfaux also provide warehouse racking and pallet racking solutions, including service and associated equipment.

Infinitely variable lift and lower control provides smooth control for precise platform work. Unlike Standard Counterbalance and Reach Forklifts, These forklifts are steered via the front swivel articulation of the forklift and are therefore much different to manoeuvre than regular forklifts and additionally have no pantograph feature for retrieving stock in narrow aisles.</p>
<p>Hyster® i3 Technology integrates commonality among Hyster warehouse products and simplifies the way in which operators and technicians alike handle and service the truck. The Neos II 14 - 16 - 20 ac reach trucks with retractable mast are the best products of their kind available on the market and can provide maximum performance under any operating conditions.</p>
