Our range of second hand order pickers make for faster, more accurate order picking.

<p>ACT offers very flexible forklift rental time frames, as well as other material handling equipment rental packages.

LOAD CENTER: The horizontal longitudinal distance from the intersection of the horizontal load-carrying surfaces and vertical load-engaging faces of the forks (or equivalent load positioning structure) to the center of gravity of the load.</p>
<p>Motorized hand trucks must enter elevator or other confined areas with load end forward. There is a structure of movable parts which enable proper operating of the forklifts. The Industrial Duty Pallet Jack is great for small spaces, and handles easily. The Hummer seems to be able to age well no matter how old it gets; and it also somehow avoids the Tonka toy look that sometimes befouls trucks when you try to put tires too large on them.</p>
