<p>BVA offers a wide range of industrial products to suit any industry including construction, mining, oil, forestry, foundation repair, MRO, OEMs and more. The dashboards of forklifts today use computers. Our rental lift trucks are maintained to the industry's highest standards and undergo comprehensive pre-rental inspections to ensure consistent performance and reliable operations. Before choosing a standup forklift, it's important to determine the size of the typical load that you will be lifting. Contact BigRentz at (888) 325-5172 to find the right rough terrain forklift for your job site.</p>
<p>Reach trucks have baselegs extending from the tractor to support the load. Some of the pallet trucks also independently reduce high speeds when cornering, adjust their drive behavior to the current situation, or help when climbing gradients. Rather than increasing the distance between the body and the frame, a suspension lift kit either replaces or adjusts the truck's leaf springs to lift its suspension.</p>
