Most trucks on the market today are built with what is commonly referred to as a body-on-frame design; the frame is built for the engine, drivetrain, and suspension, then a separate body is attached to the frame.</p>
<p>They can weather any environment and derive fuel from multiple sources, but they do not have the unique capacities that reach forklifts do.
