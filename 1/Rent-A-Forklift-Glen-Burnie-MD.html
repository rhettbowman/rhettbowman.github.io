<p>We provide high quality counterbalance forklift, reach forklift truck, pallet truck, stacker dedicated to your business. The counterbalance forklift is a popular lift that features forks in the front and a weight in the back of the vehicle to counterbalance the weight of the load. Popular brands of standup forklifts include Yale, Crown, Baker, Hyster, and Raymond, which range in price from as little as $5,000 used to as much as $35,000 for a fully equipped new machine. Counterbalanced forklifts carry their loads in front of their support point.</p>
<p>Forklift types vary in several aspects, from their fuel type and tire composition to their lift capacity and height.

That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>In addition to forklifts, we rent forklift attachments, aerial lifts, pallet jacks, sweeper scrubbers, and utility vehicles. In a factory setting, the electric forklift can operate all day on a single charge. 2. 2 Disclaimer This presentation is intended as a resource for providing training on OSHA's revised powered industrial truck operator standards.
