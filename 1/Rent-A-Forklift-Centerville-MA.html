<p>This course is designed to provide experienced operators with relevant knowledge and understanding of practical use of the Industrial Counterbalance Forklift.

For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical or at full rearward till, whichever is less stable.</p>

Those are the vehicles that you will need to test drive before making a decision.
