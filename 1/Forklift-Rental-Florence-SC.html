The counterbalance forklift features two forks at the front and has the ability to drive up close to a load to pick it up and move it.

<p>You can already see that lifted trucks have some real advantages when it comes to going off-road, thanks to the greater clearance they enjoy. Operators should be trained to operate the type of trucks they work on. They should also know the potential risks for each model. Descriptive, task-oriented names (such as side loader, high-lift pallet‚Äù forklift) aside, forklifts are often referred to in more colloquial terms.</p>
<p>Handle only loads within the rated capacity of the truck. Rated capacity of the truck must be visible by the operator. Better visibility With a lifted truck you are situated higher giving you better visibility. Looking for a custom, lifted truck in the Clearwater area can be hard at times especially finding a company that comes with a full back warranty, 3-year, 36,000 miles.</p>
