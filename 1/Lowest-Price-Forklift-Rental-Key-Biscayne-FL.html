<p>When comparing between electric and gas-fueled forklift types, the choice comes down to a warehouse's needs. Conversion training - This is for those who have experience with some type of forklift truck but wish to advance into other types. If you're looking for a warehouse forklift, It's important to consider aisle width. Choose from corrosion-resistant pallet jacks for demanding environments, or all-terrain jacks for navigating various types of ground surfaces.</p>
<p>The cost to rent a narrow aisle forklift is roughly $200 to $300 per day, $400 to $500 per week, and $1,000 to $1,500 per month. These machines can also navigate fields, pastures, pens, and loading areas. The largest of the "core" line of cushion trucks, the 15,500 lb. truck has the largest counterweight and the largest lifting capacity. Because of the additional weight from larger tires on your lifted truck, frequent oil changes are recommended when you lift your truck or SUV.</p>
