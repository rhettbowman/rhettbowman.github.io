<p>Powerful performance meets compact design. Trucks with a body lift often have a visible gap between the frame and body, which a lot of people find unsightly. This is due to the fact that a used forklift really has no suspension and it is not possible to maintain tire to ground contact in uneven environments. These fees are based on the length of the time you have your rental. The hand pallet truck lift offers load shifting, lifting and lowering functions.</p>
<p>So while you may find cheaper custom trucks elsewhere, we doubt they'll compare to the quality you get from us. Granite industrial carries an inventory full of used Baker and Linde forklift truck parts. Most order picker forklifts have a 4-point suspension mechanism between the rear tires and the front wheels. The wheels and tires are key components that set rough terrain forklifts apart from standard models.</p>
<h2>Hand Pallet Truck  Geneva </h2>

<p>Any time the forklift's center of gravity moves outside the stability triangle, the lift will tip over. Like the pallets themselves, pallet jacks have become a lot more standardized in North America as of late. Southeast Forklifts specializes in high quality, thoroughly inspected and reconditioned equipment you can trust. From the moment you first step into the reception area, decorated with handmade up-cycled furniture built from old pallets to the large warehouse space where the forklifts, order pickers, boom, and scissor lifts all operate, we have made a huge effort for the whole place to be a positive, professional, clean, modern and friendly environment.</p>

<p>While most standard forklifts can reach between 10 and 15 feet, a telehandler can lift to heights of 55 feet. As already mentioned, choosing a forklift with the right handling capacity is therefore essential. Forklifts come in a variety of shapes and sizes to do various jobs. You'll often see these forklifts traveling down the highway on the back of semi-truck trailers.</p>
