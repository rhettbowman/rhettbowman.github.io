<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Begin your inspection facing the front of the forklift. Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida. Since electric forklifts use a battery, there are no fuel costs; they operate a great deal more quietly than internal combustion engines and last longer than internal combustion engines because they have less moving parts.</p>
<p>This allows it to lift small loads into tight spaces. This allows for completion of work at heights that normal forklifts cannot reach. Generally, a lifted truck has the main frame and chassis raised up one or more feet above where it would normally sit on top of the tires. Be sure to find out what kind of warranty exists on the forklift. In addition to a control to raise and lower the forks (also known as blades or tines), the operator can tilt the mast to compensate for a load's tendency to angle the blades toward the ground and risk slipping off the forks.</p>

Many of the hazards posed by forklifts can be mitigated with custom signage and clear visual communication.</p>
<p>When standard pallet sizes launched in 1930, forklifts became even more useful.

Affordability - Rental forklift is highly affordable; you can rent a high-capacity forklift at a very reasonable cost.</p>

Mitsubishi counterbalance forklifts are designed for exceptional comfort and increased productivity - from beginning of the shift to the end. Some order pickers are in a climate-controlled environment, while others work in sub-freezing temperatures.
